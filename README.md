### I400 Prototyping With Arduino Tools Project 3: Gallery Artifact
Device built and programmed by Amanda Sill

Components:
* 1 Arduino Uno
* 1 4-digit 7-segment display
* 1 Real Time Clock
* 1 Potentiometer
* 6 Neopixels
* 20 gauge wire
* Magnets
* Glue

Housing was made with a combination of laser cutting, 3D printing, and plaster cast for texture.

Time is displayed in 24 hour format on the 7-segment display. On the top of the hour (the it is 00 minutes) the neopixels turn on for 60 seconds; their brightness is controlled by the potentiometer.
